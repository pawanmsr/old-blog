The coronavirus has been a bad chapter in the civilizational timeline. I saw, heard and experienced events that scarred my mind (and more waves are predicted to follow). Lockdown stalling economic movement, businesses failing (specially travel and hospitality) while others performing on the edge of their absolute efficiency (healthcare). Furthermore, the social media explosion - everyone with the ability to write is sharing their thoughts and sometimes so convincingly (and without any factual basis) that it is outright manipulative. On one hand I witness people taking their last breath, and on the other hand I open smartphone application to find folks my age sharing their couple goals. I try my best to keep busy and distracted. Here's a short amusing poem from my journal:

My poems are result of my reveries. I just hope to get a few laughs off the reader - I know better than to offend anyone especially ladies. If you are offended, please [vent out](mailto:{{ site.author.email }}?subject=Reproval!) - but know that I have written way twisted (but hilarious) poems and jokes.  

N.H. Kleinbaum, Dead Poets Society:

> but only in their dreams can men be truly free. 'twas always thus and always thus will be.  

Ofcourse there isn't one right person for everyone - we aren't a jigsaw puzzle, are we? Even if there were people absolutely right for each other, it would be unlikely that they sample each other out from the masses.

To give a perspective, the pani puri seller at the corner of the crossroad would meet with more ladies in an hour on a nice cloudy afternoon, than many guys (pursuing higher education or in academia) will ever meet; that too whilst earning a handsome amount in few hours of festive business (often without any tax liability). The pani puri seller has a greater chance of finding the love of his life than someone who isn't as socially available - how is a soldier who is on high stakes deployement, or a submariner working inside an active patrol vessel going to meet someone (except on their vacations).

Whatever it may be, I hope you find *the one* to back you up as you traverse through life. And even if you don't, try not to feel too dejected - *alone is probably better*.

Most aero-systems need stabilization during flight to prevent loss of control, and maintain their course. Depending upon the properties of the ambient atmosphere (or lack thereof), and the system in consideration, method of stabilization is selected. [Fin stabilization](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stabilizer_(aeronautics)) is the most common form of stabilization when ambient fluid is dense. Fins that can actively change their configuration are called control surfaces. Most active stabilization use gyroscope for motion reference. A large enough gyroscope can also be used for stabilization, but it is not common [SIT]. Systems that do not depend on the ambient fluid for stabilization often use [thrust vectoring](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thrust_vectoring).

Most thrust vector control have hydraulic or pneumatic actuation system (or combination of both in a force transfer mechanism). In this project I wish to demonstrate (shielded) electromagnetic actuation system. This has some obvious advantage (and disadvantage).

### Advantages

- Force transfer mechanism is electrical: less weight.
- (Possibly) Lesser number of moving parts.

Status: Stalled.  

This has been an individual experimental hobby initiative. At the moment, I lack the necessary resources and fortitude to keep actively pursuing it and that too without proper review process for its credibility. This isn't much, but if you are inspired by it in anyway and find it to be new then please cite and if possible let's collaborate - I will be grateful.

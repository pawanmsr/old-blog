## Hour Long Artwork

Technical arts has been one of my favourite topics to learn and practice. Few engineers these days learn it like I learnt - everything is digital - and often takes a lot less time to draw.

I have added minimal detailing to give it a cartoonish appearance. Moreover, adding many details requires a lot more focus and longer to complete, which often leads to loss of the amusement one gets from the activity.

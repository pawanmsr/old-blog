## Hour Long Artwork

Technical arts has been one of my favourite topics to learn and practice. Few engineers these days learn it like I learnt - everything is digital - and often takes a lot less time to draw.

I have added minimal detailing to give it a cartoonish appearance. Moreover, adding many details requires a lot more focus and longer to complete, which often leads to loss of the amusement one gets from the activity.

Super-maneuverable, multi-role, air superiority fighter aircraft. Indian Air Force operates over 250 of these heavy, long-range, twinjets. This is a scaled approximate non technical representation inspired from visual inspection.  

![MiG 21 Bis](/img/mig-21.svg)

Most produced supersonic combat aircraft. Performs as a fighter-interceptor. Numbers Built: 11,496 (10,645 by USSR, 194 by Czechoslovakia, 657 by India). They are pretty old - will be decommissioned in few years. This is a scaled approximate non technical representation inspired from visual inspection.
